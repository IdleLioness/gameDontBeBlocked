Don't Be Blocked

Don't Be Blocked is a simple game project reminiscent of Tetris, where the player must evade falling blocks. Blocks continuously descend towards the player, who can move left and right using the "A" and "D" keys respectively. Additionally, the player can use the "S" key to clear the level if they have accumulated enough energy.

The primary goal of the game is survival, with the player earning points for both surviving and clearing blocks.
